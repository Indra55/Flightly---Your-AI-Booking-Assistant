## Usage

The system provides several functionalities:

1. **Booking a Ticket**:
    To book a flight ticket, call the `book_ticket` method from the `BookingSystem` class. Example:
    ```python
    booking_data = booking_system.book_ticket(
        destination="London", 
        num_tickets=1, 
        ticket_class="economy", 
        email="user@example.com", 
        date_str="2025-03-15", 
        seat_prefs={"location": "aisle"}, 
        meal_prefs={"type": "vegetarian"}, 
        special_requests="Extra legroom"
    )
    ```

2. **Checking Flight Availability**:
    To check the availability of a flight on a specific date:
    ```python
    availability = flight_db.check_availability("london", "2025-03-15", "economy")
    ```

3. **AI Assistant**:
    The AI assistant can help answer flight-related queries. Example:
    ```python
    assistant = AirlineAssistant()
    response = assistant.model.ask("What is the price for a business class ticket to London?")
    print(response)
    ```
